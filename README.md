Hello 👋 I'm Pedro Paula, a Web Development student at the University of the Azores, currently doing an internship at Ahau Software. 
I have hands-on experience with technologies such as HTML5, CSS/SASS, JavaScript, PHP, C#, ASP.NET, .NET, and SQL. 
I often use Bootstrap to streamline my frontend development, and I follow the Scrum methodology in my workflow. 
I'm passionate about expanding my knowledge in areas like Node.js, C#, computer science, and team leadership. 
Outside of tech, I'm an active roller hockey player and a base coach, bringing the same energy and teamwork from the rink into every project I work on.
