Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm Pedro Paula, a highly motivated Junior Web Developer from Portugal. 
I'm interested in learning new languages like React and Computer Science. 
Currently, I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. I use Bootstrap as a JavaScript framework. 
I'm dedicated to enhancing my skills as a developer and I'm also keen on learning about Team Management.
